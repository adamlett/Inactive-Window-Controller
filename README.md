# Inactive-Window-Controller
Allows page control of PDFs or PowerPoints that are not the active window. Useful for dual monitor / split window setups or very useful when combined with a tool called OnTopReplica https://ontopreplica.codeplex.com/ 

Assigns dynamically chosen hotkeys to control the next/previous page functions of Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Chrome and Adobe Reader, without needing active window focus.

Works very well with combined with OnTopReplica and allows for a resizable, always-on-top  window that can be controlled without needing the active window to be the document you are viewing. Also useful for general multi-monitor or split window setups

Written in AutoHotkey and available as either an AHK script or a portable self-contained executable.
